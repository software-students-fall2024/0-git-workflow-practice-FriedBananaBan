## What's so Interesting?
    We have all heard about legacy codes that only god and the programmer from 10 years ago knows how it works. 
Trying to edit this code just leads to problems and is a complete waste of time. This article gives you tips on
how to avoid this scenario from happening. For example, the article tells you to write code that is easy to delete.
Since lowering the lines of code also lowers the cost of maintenance, you should try and build software that is 
disposible rather than re-usable.

I find this article interesting because as students we are not often taught how to manage code but only how to write code. In my past assignments from previous courses, I've always tried to incorporate most of the code in a single class thats filled with numerous functions and loops. In hindsight, it would've been so much better organzied and readable when debugging if I had broken it down into pieces and created libraries with functions
